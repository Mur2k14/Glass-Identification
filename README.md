# Glass-Identification
This model makes use of K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify glasses based on the content present in them.
We are going to use these contents as our features to group together the data points that exihibit similar features.
Here, we have calculated the optimum efficiency of the model by using both Euclidean and Manhattan method for calculating 
the distance between the datapoints and finally, the cross validation score is applied to the model for finding the best K
value and its corresponding accuracy.
